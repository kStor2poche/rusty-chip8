// TODO: We'll handle part of Chip8's display here
// idk what to use, there are some simple framebuffer crates existing, but I could also try
// something like EGUI
// minifb seems like a good starting point, especially regarding the way the data will be
// (crate already added !)
// organized + we could apparently use it for our input !
//
// note : the main minifb loop will have to live... in main, you guessed it...
